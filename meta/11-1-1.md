national_indicator_description: <p>Informal Settlements; Informal settlements are usually seen as synonymous of slums, with a particular focus on the formal status of land, structure and services. They are defined by three main criteria, according to Habitat III Issue Paper #2210, which are already covered in the definition of slums. These are; 1. Inhabitants have no security of tenure vis-à-vis the land or dwellings they inhabit, with modalities ranging from squatting to informal rental housing, 2. The neighbourhoods usually lack, or are cut off from, formal basic services and city infrastructure, and 3. The housing may not comply with current planning and building regulations, is often situated in geographically and environmentally hazardous areas, and may lack a municipal permit. Informal settlements can be occupied by all income levels of urban residents, affluent and poor.</p> Inadequate Housing; Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes housing as one of the components of the right to adequate standards of living for all.11 The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights’ general comments No.4 (1991) on the right to adequate housing and No.7 (1997) on forced evictions have underlined that the right to adequate housing should be seen as the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity. For housing to be adequate, it must provide more than four walls and a roof, and at a minimum, meet the following criteria; 1. Legal security of tenure, which guarantees legal protection against forced evictions, harassment and other threats; 2. Availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, including safe drinking water, adequate sanitation, energy for cooking, heating, lighting, food storage or refuse disposal; 3. Affordability, as housing is not adequate if its cost threatens or compromises the occupants’ enjoyment of other human rights; 4. Habitability, as housing is not adequate if it does not guarantee physical safety or provide adequate space, as well as protection against the cold, damp, heat, rain, wind, other threats to health and structural hazards; 5. Accessibility, as housing is not adequate if the specific needs of disadvantaged and marginalized groups are not taken into account (such as the poor, people facing discrimination; persons with disabilities, victims of natural disasters); 6. Location, as housing is not adequate if it is cut off from employment opportunities, health-care services, schools, childcare centres and other social facilities, or if located in dangerous or polluted sites or in immediate proximity to pollution sources; and 7. Cultural adequacy, as housing is not adequate if it does not respect and take into account the expression of cultural identity and ways of life.
